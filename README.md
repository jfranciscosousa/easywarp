This plugin allows players to warp between their defined warps.

Define a warp in-game by using:
``/setwarp <warpname>``

Warp to your defined warp by using:
``/warp <warpname>``

Delete warps by using:
``/delwarp <warpname>``

List warps by:
``/listwarps <prefix/page>``

Warps are stored in a binary format in the plugin config folder.
